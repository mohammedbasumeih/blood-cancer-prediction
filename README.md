# Blood-Cancer-Prediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning system to predict blood cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system processes blood sample images, extracts relevant features, and classifies them to assist in the early detection of blood cancer. It includes steps such as data preprocessing, model training, and testing, followed by performance evaluation through metrics and visualizations.

Contains:

Data preprocessing scripts for image cleaning and augmentation.
CNN model architecture for feature extraction and classification.
Training and testing code with evaluation metrics.
Visualizations of the results using Matplotlib to analyze model performance.
This project aims to enhance the accuracy of blood cancer detection, helping medical professionals in making timely diagnoses.
